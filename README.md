installed in npm ->
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled @mui/icons-material --save

look up " sx prop" for styling components
-> https://mui.com/system/the-sx-prop/
--> default for styling   
search api for actual prop. Styling could be made more typical for project
example: button
-> https://mui.com/api/button/
-> using fab as a component (rounded corners )
https://mui.com/api/fab/

Creating 'theme.js'
-> https://mui.com/customization/color/
-> pallete on mui is what you can change 

To override styles use:
https://mui.com/system/styled/
-putting it inside of 'pallete'
